# Geometric-Shape-Recognition-Python-ML
This project implements two machine learning approaches for recognizing hand-drawn geometric shapes. The system classifies images into eight different geometric categories using both traditional feature extraction with Random Forest and modern convolutional neural networks (CNN).
